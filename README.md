This project follows the book Symfony 5: The Fast Track by Fabien Potencier.

It doesn't track the book exactly though. I am using it to familiarise myself
with Symfony 5's features, but I find it easier to do that by playing with the
features and using my own software engineering experience rather than following 
the book's instructions by rote.

There are a few outstanding things I would like to do in this project. I am currently
reading chapters 9 and 10 of the book. Here I would like to:

1. Replicate the functionality provided by the easy admin package whilst avoiding
   using the package. This includes the following:
   
   Conferences
   
   a. Creating a tabular view of all the conferences
   
   b. Adding a modal form to create conferences
   
   c. Adding a way to edit existing conferences. In easy admin this is done within
      the table, but we could also use another modal form like the add form.
      
   d. Allow deletion of conferences in the tabular UI
   
   Comments
   
   a. Create a tabular view of all of the comments
   
   b. Add a modal form to create comments
   
   c. Adding a way to edit existing comments. Similar to editing conferences above.
   
   d. Allow deletion of comments
